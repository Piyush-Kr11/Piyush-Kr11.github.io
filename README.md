# Biography

I am currently pursuing a Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at IIIT-H, following a diverse academic and professional journey. With a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering from Jadavpur University, I have seamlessly transitioned from mechanical systems to the digital world of computing. This interdisciplinary background provides a unique perspective on problem-solving, combining the rigor of mechanical engineering with the innovation of computer science.

Before embarking on my M.Tech journey, I worked as a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), where they gained valuable experience in business strategy, data analysis, and project management. 

Outside of academics and work, I am passionate about cricket and reading novels. I enjoy playing cricket as a way to stay active and sharpen their team-building skills. When not on the field, I can often be found immersed in novels, exploring a wide range of genres that fuel their creativity and broaden their worldview.
